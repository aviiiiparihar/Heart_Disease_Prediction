## üîç Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Loaded the dataset
   - Checked for null values
   - Converted categorical features using one-hot encoding

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Visualized feature distributions
   - Correlation heatmap
   - Identified relationships between features and target

3. **Modeling**
   - Trained multiple classification models:
     - Logistic Regression
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
     - Decision Tree
     - Random Forest
   - Used train-test split for evaluation

4. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Accuracy Score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
   - ROC-AUC curve

## üèÜ Best Model

- **Random Forest Classifier**
- Achieved high accuracy and balanced precision-recall performance

---

## üí° Key Learnings

- Importance of preprocessing and encoding categorical variables
- Comparison of multiple classifiers helps select the most robust one
- Visual tools (like ROC curves) aid in model evaluation and selection
